# Data Science Workflow

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to extract insights from data.

## The Data Science Process

### 1. Data Collection
Gathering relevant data from various sources:
- Databases and data warehouses
- APIs and web scraping
- Sensor data and IoT devices
- Surveys and questionnaires

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Preparing data for analysis:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates and outliers
- Data type conversions
- Feature engineering

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding the data through:
- Statistical summaries
- Data visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Pattern identification

### 4. Model Building and Training
Developing predictive models:
- Algorithm selection
- Feature selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation

### 5. Model Evaluation and Deployment
Assessing and implementing models:
- Performance metrics
- Model validation
- Production deployment
- Monitoring and maintenance
