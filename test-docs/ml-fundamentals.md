# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. Common examples include:
- Linear regression for predicting continuous values
- Classification algorithms for categorizing data

### Unsupervised Learning  
Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns in data without labeled examples. Key techniques include:
- Clustering to group similar data points
- Dimensionality reduction to simplify complex datasets

### Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data, particularly effective for:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
