# Neural Networks Deep Dive

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. They are fundamental to deep learning and modern AI applications.

## Architecture

### Basic Components
- **Neurons (Nodes)**: Basic processing units that receive inputs, apply weights, and produce outputs
- **Layers**: Collections of neurons organized in input, hidden, and output layers
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that determine the strength and nature of connections between neurons
- **Activation Functions**: Mathematical functions that determine neuron output based on weighted inputs

### Types of Neural Networks
- **Feedforward Networks**: Information flows in one direction from input to output
- **Recurrent Networks (RNNs)**: Include feedback loops, allowing information to persist
- **Convolutional Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images
- **Transformer Networks**: Attention-based architectures for sequence processing

## Training Process

### Forward Propagation
1. Input data is fed through the network layer by layer
2. Each neuron applies weights, biases, and activation functions
3. Final output is compared to expected result

### Backpropagation
1. Calculate error between predicted and actual output
2. Propagate error backwards through the network
3. Adjust weights and biases to minimize error
4. Repeat process over multiple iterations (epochs)

## Applications
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing and translation
- Speech recognition and synthesis
- Game playing and decision making
- Financial modeling and fraud detection
