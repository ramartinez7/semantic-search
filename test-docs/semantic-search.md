# Semantic Search Technology

Semantic search uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand the intent and contextual meaning of search queries. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, semantic search can find relevant content even when exact keywords don't match.

## How It Works
- Text embeddings capture semantic meaning
- Vector similarity matching
- Context-aware ranking
- Query understanding

## Benefits
- Better search relevance
- Handles synonyms and related concepts
- Understands user intent
- Multilingual capabilities
